To execute this you need to have rust installed with a nightly toolchain of version 1.58 or greater to make use of edition 2021 and `#![feature(generators)]`

you can get it by using `rustup toolchain add nightly-2021-11-01` (to get the nightly v1.58) and `rustup override set [The toolchain that got installed]` to set the currrent toolchain to the nightly rust 1.58. As of writing this nightly v1.71 also works.
